### Hi there, I'm Akash Kothawade <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

🌟 **About Me**  
I am a **software engineer** with a passion for building scalable and efficient solutions across both backend and frontend. On the backend, I have extensive experience designing and implementing robust microservices and APIs, working with technologies like **Node.js**, **Go**, **MongoDB**, and **PostgreSQL**. I also have a strong focus on performance optimization, including caching with **Redis**. On the frontend, I enjoy building intuitive user interfaces with **React.js** and **Next.js**.

I thrive on solving complex problems and love the challenge of creating elegant, efficient solutions. I continuously improve my skills across full-stack development, always adapting to new technologies and optimizing systems for performance and scalability, with experience in cloud platforms like **AWS**.


I am a **software engineer** with a passion for building scalable, efficient, and intelligent systems.  
- 💻 On the **backend**, I design and implement robust microservices & APIs using **Node.js**, **Go**, and databases like **MongoDB** & **PostgreSQL**, with performance optimizations through **Redis**.  
- 🎨 On the **frontend**, I build clean and intuitive UIs using **React.js** and **Next.js**.  
- ☁️ I have hands-on experience with **cloud platforms (AWS)**, ensuring scalability and reliability.  
- 🤖 Recently, I’ve been exploring the world of **Generative AI** — building with **LLMs, RAG, AI Agents, and Vector DBs**, and integrating frameworks like **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to create intelligent, production-ready solutions.  

I thrive on solving complex problems, continuously learning, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with software & AI. 🚀
